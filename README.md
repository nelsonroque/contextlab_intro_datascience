## Mission
Make available a set of open-source materials to learn how to engage in reproducible science, leveraging code-based techniques.

This repository is intended to house various sample workflows, and code snippets, to support research + data science activities.

## Modules

### General
- [Intro to Reproducible Science](modules/general/Intro%20to%20Reproducible%20Science/)

### R
- [Intro to Data Wrangling](modules/R/Intro%20to%20Data%20Wrangling/)
- [Intro to Predictive Modeling](modules/R/Intro%20to%20Predictive%20Modeling/)
- [Working with Keystroke data](modules/R/Working%20with%20Keystroke%20Data/)

## Future Directions
