# What is reproducible science?

Making entire scientific process transparent (when and as allowable by law, grants).

  - Sharing experiment and analysis code
  - Detailed methods sections
  - Sharing stimulus sets
  - Being able to walk through a data analysis start (load raw data) to finish (manuscript analyses) in code
  - Following FAIR Principles
  - Pre-registering hypotheses and analysis plans (e.g., on OSF)

## Why should you care?

Ioannidis, John P A. 2005. “Why Most Published Research Findings Are False.” PLoS Medicine 2 (8): e124. doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124.

Open Science Collaboration. 2015. “Estimating the Reproducibility of Psychological Science.” Science 349 (6251): aac4716–aac4716. doi:10.1126/science.aac4716.

# FAIR Principles

## F: Findable

"The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services"

## A: Accessible
"Once the user finds the required data, she/he/they need to know how they can be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation."

## I: Interoperable

"The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing."

## R: Reusable

"The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings."

# Reproducible Science Tools

- R
- Latex, Markdown
- Python
- Github
- Docker, VMs
- AWS CDK

---

# What is Github?

A platform to store and collaborate on code.

[Get Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

[Get Github Cheatsheets](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/)

---

# Github Concepts:

  - Repository: a logical unit of storage for maintaining code/other assets. Can contain many folders, files.
  - .gitignore: a file (with dot prefix) to specify what files should NOT be pushed to Github
  - .gitkeep: a file (with dot prefix) to specify that a folder should be kept if blank as part of the project structure. This is helpful when creating templates.
  - 'commit': create a record/snapshot of all files (or specific files) at a moment in time. You may tag collaborators, add a title and notes.
  - 'push': 'storing' the result of prior commits
  - 'pull': 'extracting' the result of prior commits
  - 'diff': difference (line-specific) between two commits. Helpful when trying to remember when and where code edits where made.

# What is R? 

Statistical programming language. Similar to `S`

## What is RStudio?

Integrated development environment (IDE) for R

## What is RMarkdown?

Reproducible notebook (akin to Jupyter Notebooks in Python) where you can write a narrative using Markdown syntax and embed code/plots throughout.

---

# What are R packages?

Think of the iOS App Store, or Google Play Store - that is the equivalent of CRAN - where you download published R packages.

A developer can also make packages available directly in source code, or via tools like Github, for example:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nelsonroque/ruf")
```

---

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown presentation. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

---

# Endnote

## What is Endnote?

A citation manager for research projects. 

Here is a [guide from the UCF library with installation links](https://guides.ucf.edu/citations-endnote).

## Why Endnote?
  - no need for manual tracking (deleting, updating) of references
  - change citation format at click of a button
  - capture PDFs for any citations at click of a button

## Downloads:
  - [Mac](http://ezproxy.library.ucf.edu/loggedin/EndNote20SiteInstaller.zip)
  - [Windows](http://ezproxy.library.ucf.edu/loggedin/EndNote20.zip)
